As the focus of the latest assignment was on developing a HTML webpage, the weeks leading up to it were focussed on developing the knowledge necessary. 
The provided html documents were the pieces of classword submitted in Weeks 1 and 2 of the semester. The documents have a clear progression in skill; the first has no formatting or interesting layout, while the second includes more components, such as divs and images. The final assessment submission also uses javascript and more css properties to create an engaging and interesting website. 
This progression in skill was important, as the final assessment submitted and the second provided document have multiple similarities; both have fillers on the side of the content, both have a one-column layout in the middle. This shows the skills gained from practising HTML paid off, as they allowed for the development of the assessment. Additionally, even during the development of the assessment piece, more features (such as fixed positions, more advanced javascript) were learnt. 

The final assessment piece did, however, not achieve high marks for documentation. 

 - “Website comparison explains key elements of both websites, but avoids analysing each element in depth, and just summarises at the end of the page”

This was partially due to not analysing website components. It is said that if you can't explain something, you don't understand it well enough; as the documentation requirements were to explain the purposes of the HTML, CSS and Javascript present in the submitted, and other, this suggests more study should have been done into the purposes instead of the application. When doing future assessments, more focus will be on gaining a greater understanding of the theories; this will also result in greater understanding of its applications.

This knowledge of HTML is also beneficial for the next topic of study: web scraping. Beautifulsoup or other web scraping softwares require HTML component names/ids/tags to locate the required information; to implement this, knowledge is required of what those elements are. Thus, learning HTML was a necessity to continue study in web scraping.
