As the focus of the latest assignment was on developing a HTML webpage, the weeks leading up to it were focussed on developing knowledge of the technologies. 

Week 1 was dedicated to learning HTML, a markup language used to create web pages. This week was dedicated to learning and using the various tags and properties in HTML.  This knowledge was used to create ‘week1.html’ in Week 1. 
CSS was learnt in Week 2. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to add styles and colour to a HTML webpage. This was added to ‘week1.html’ to develop ‘week2.html’. 

The documents have a clear progression in skill, as the first has a layout similar to that of a Google Docs or Word document; it consists of simply headers and paragraph text. In contrast, the second includes more components: it uses divs, to structure the webpage and make styling those different sections easy by applying a class to them. It also uses the style tag to hold the necessary CSS, making the website more appealing and easy to style (as all classes or groups of elements can be styled at once instead of individually). 

The final assessment submission includes more elements, such as fixed positions (a property of CSS that allows elements to remain on a webpage):
