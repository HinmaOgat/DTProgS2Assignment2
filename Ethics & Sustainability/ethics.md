Ethics
---
The intention of using colour and layout theory is to guide the user through the webpage; for example, certain layouts encourage users to select elements for advertising purposes. However, this can be used maliciously, through dark patterns. Dark patterns involve the designing of a user interface to manipulate users into performing certain actions such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills (Hannah, 2022). They are employed by websites frequently; one example is the ‘close’ button on a Microsoft update popup triggering an immediate software update (Hannah, 2022).  
Dark patterns are destructive for any webpage that is intended to be visited multiple times.  While they can make a user do what the website wants them to do, which is useful in the short term, they can also make a user’s experience negative, they can damage the reputation of a brand and they are, in some US states, illegal.  
To avoid the use of dark patterns, (as they can be used unintentionally), a UI should be transparent. The language and elements in a web page should be neutral and straightforward; it should help the user in making informed decisions, and should perform whatever action is expected when interacted with (Hannah, 2022). This will be important in future tasks; the UIs developed until now have been simple, but as more functionality is added, effort will be required to ensure the final product is simple and free of dark patterns.

Additionally, accessibility issues need to be addressed when developing user interfaces. Certain disabilities can prevent a webpage from being usable; a web page should be simple enough to minimise this inconvenience as much as possible. For example, text and background should be contrasting to ensure colour-blindness will not interfere with a disabled user’s understanding of content (this was also a web design theory researched). Additionally, people with varying levels of eyesight should be able to use the site. The final HTML task submission included text and size customizability options specifically for those purposes:

Web Pages also need to be usable on different devices, as users may only have a certain screen to access a user interface. All user interfaces in future should have the ability to adapt to different screen sizes; in HTML, this can be done by setting the width properties of elements to percentages instead of pixels. This ensures the layout is bigger or smaller depending on the screen, instead of a fixed size that is unviewable because a screen is too small. This was implemented in the HTML task submission with moderate success:

As shown, most elements within the page are capable of maintaining their percentage widths when the screen width changes, with the exception of elements such as the slider and the menu items.

Understanding the ethics of UI development will ensure that, when developing a UI in the future with the skills gained from understanding [design](/UI%20Design%20And%20Layout/UIDesignAndLayout.md) and [technology](/Technologies/Html%20Knowledge.md) theories, the interfaces will be as user-friendly and ethical as possible.
