UI Design And Layout
---
The main focus of Term 3 was HTML and the development of a webpage. However, this was supported by assessment items from the previous term, mainly the PySimpleGui tasks.  
A user interface is defined as the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device (Churchville, 2024). As both a PySimpleGUI GUI and a HTML webpage involve user interaction with a computer, they are both User Interfaces. Thus, the feedback from the PySimpleGUI tasks could be applied to the HTML task.  

An area of weakness that was improved on this term was colour scheme selection. Feedback on usability tests for the last PySimpleGUI assessment, and teacher feedback on PySimpleGui assessments, all mentioned the colour choice used was not optimal:

- "The format is an awful color"
- "It doesn’t look the best (referring to colour scheme)"
- "The white text on black can be a bit hard to read clearly at small fonts, so be careful with that"

Thus, throughout the development of the HTML task, research was done into colour theory and design to select the best colour palette. For example, any web page should have a primary colour (60% of webpage, such as background), a secondary colour (30% of webpage, as element colour) and an accent colour (10% of webpage). Additionally, the text present in the webpage should contrast its background to ensure greater legibility. (Corrigan, n.d.).  
Hence, the colour scheme was chosen to be white, green and purple, as they all work well with white and black text to ensure readable content. The text colour customizability options were also implemented, to make the content more personalisable (thus easier to read) for the user.

Additionally, research was done into different website layouts. For example, the one-column layout (used in week2.html and the final HTML task submission), is easy to follow, and makes it so the need to scan is nothing more than identifying key points of interest into that single column. (ColibriWP, 2021). This means it is good for simple websites that do not require many different types of information to be displayed at once.

More focus should have been placed on formatting aspects of each individual element in the website.

- “The table of contents on the left could be tidied a little, possibly by making the links the same style as the hyperlinks at the top”
- “The cards in your website research section are good, but I believe you should probably have formatted the text in them a little cleaner, something about them feels cluttered”.

Formatting within elements was not prioritised during development of the site, as the overall layout was deemed more important. Thus, future assignments will prioritise the setup of content inside elements. However, it is worth noting that the elements of the webpage were customisable due to the website being largely text-based and flexible; there was choice for the contents. In future, information such as data (graphs and tables) may not be so customisable.

UIs are what allow humans to interact with a device's underlying code (Juviler, 2022). In future, any software involving user interactions, such as one using Flask or any other software as a back-end, will need a front-end to be designed, otherwise it will not be useful. The research and experimentation done into web design will ensure any UIs developed in future will be more user-friendly, with a more appealing colour scheme and layout. This knowledge, when paired with the skills gained from [learning the technologies of HTML, CSS and Javascript](/Technologies/Html%20Knowledge.md), will ensure the development of good UIs in the future.
