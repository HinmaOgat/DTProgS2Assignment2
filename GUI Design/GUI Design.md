The main focus of Term 3 was HTML and the development of a webpage. However, this was supported by assessment items from the previous term; notably, the PySimpleGui tasks.

Pysimplegui, being a Python-based GUI library, is easier to format than HTML. This is due to having had more time to learn Python (as an entire assessment was dedicated to doing so beforehand). Additionally, HTML formatting requires use of the different tags, their positioning, and their properties; in contrast, Pysimplegui simply involves organising lists within lists. This meant, when developing the Pysimplegui applications, more focus could be directed toward the layout, as changes were easy to make. 
Thus, the PySimpleGUI assessments felt like an introduction to UI development, as a lesser-known, simpler software was used to be familiarised with developing user-friendly, appealing interfaces, before a more official language was used. 

This means the feedback gotten from the PySimpleGui assessments assisted in the development of the HTML web pages, as it was relevant for a webpage just as it was for a python GUI. For example, note the specific feedback, given on the PySImpleGui assessments, shown below:

- "The white text on black can be a bit hard to read clearly at small fonts, so be careful with that"
- "You could also bump the font size up a bit in general, as there’s a lot of screen real estate you’re not using"

These pieces of feedback were important as they were about readability, instead of layout or features; something I was not good at doing well. Thus, they were taken into consideration during the development of the HTML webpage, and features were implemented to ___ them; the grey background on black text and the size customizability options were added in response to those comments. The final assessment piece feedback mentioned the webpage was “easy to navigate and read through”; this proves the implemented features were effective, and the feedback was used well. 
Thus, this criticism allowed for the improvement of a personal weakness, ensuring it will not affect future assessments. 

However, more focus should have been placed on formatting aspects of each individual element in the website.

- “The table of contents on the left could be tidied a little, possibly by making the links the same style as the hyperlinks at the top”
- “The cards in your website research section are good, but I believe you should probably have formatted the text in them a little cleaner, something about them feels cluttered”

All constructive criticism predominantly focused on the text contained in elements throughout the page; this was not prioritised during development, as the overall layout was deemed more important. Thus, future assignments will more greatly consider how text inside elements is set up. This is more possible due to knowledge being gained about the layout of a website due to the research done for the assessment; hence, layouts of individual elements can be prioritised in future. 

Another area of weakness that was improved on was colour scheme selection. Feedback on previously designed web pages, experimental layouts for the assessment piece and usability tests for previous assessment all included disdain for the colour choice selected. Throughout this assessment, various colour schemes were experimented with. The process of selecting the correct colour scheme involved research into colour theory and design; this was valuable knowledge gained, as future UIs will require an appealing colour scheme to increase user friendliness.

UIs are what allow humans to interact with a device's underlying code (Juviler, 2022). In future, any software involving user interactions, such as one using flask or any other data science software as a back-end, will need a front-end to be designed, otherwise it will not be not useful to a user. Thus, the skills and knowledge gained from these assessments will be useful in any future Information Technology studies, as they will make the process of front-end development easier to do.
