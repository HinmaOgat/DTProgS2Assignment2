The main focus of Term 3 was HTML and the development of a webpage. However, this was supported by assessment items from the previous term; notably, the PySimpleGui tasks.

Pysimplegui was, personally, easier to format than HTML. 
This was partially due to having had more time to learn python (as an entire assessment was dedicated to doing so beforehand) This meant, when developing the Pysimplegui applications, more focus could be directed toward the layout, as changes were easy to make. Additionally, Pysimplegui formatting was more simple, due to simply being lsists within lists; in contrast, HTML formatting required use of the different tags, their positioning, their properties and more. 

Thus, the PySimpleGUI assessments felt like an introduction to GUI development, as a lesser-known, easier software was used to get the 'feel' of GUI development, before a more official language was used. 

Thus, the feedback gotten from the PySimpleGui assessments assisted in the development of the HTML webpages. For example, note the specific feedback, given on the previous assessments, shown below:

 - "The white text on black can be a bit hard to read clearly at small fonts, so be careful with that"
 - "You could also bump the font size up a bit in general, as there’s a lot of screen real estate you’re not using"

These were taken into consideration during the development of the HTML webpage (due to the non-black/white color choice and the size customisability options), and allowed for greater knowledge to be attained about GUI layout and choices. 

The information and skills gained for creating a UI are important, as UIs are what allow humans to interact with a device's underlying code*.
In future, any application made with flask or any other data science software (as an example), will need a front-end, otherwise it will not be not useful to a user. The skills and knowledge gained from these assessments will be useful in any future Information Technology study.
