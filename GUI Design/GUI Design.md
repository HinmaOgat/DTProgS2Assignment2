The main focus of Term 3 was HTML and the development of a webpage. However, this was supported by assessment items from the previous term; notably, the PySimpleGui tasks.

Pysimplegui, being a Python-based GUI library, is easier to format than HTML. This is due to having had more time to learn Python (as an entire assessment was dedicated to doing so beforehand). Additionally, Pysimplegui simply involves organising lists within lists; in contrast, HTML formatting requires use of the different tags, their positioning, their properties and more. 
This meant, when developing the Pysimplegui applications, more focus could be directed toward the layout, as changes were easy to make.

Thus, the PySimpleGUI assessments felt like an introduction to GUI development, as a lesser-known, easier software was used to get the 'feel' of GUI development, before a more official language was used. 

This means the feedback gotten from the PySimpleGui assessments assisted in the development of the HTML web pages, as it could be implemented into a webpage just as they were implementable into the python GUI. For example, note the specific feedback, given on the previous assessments, shown below:

 - "The white text on black can be a bit hard to read clearly at small fonts, so be careful with that"
 - "You could also bump the font size up a bit in general, as there’s a lot of screen real estate you’re not using"

These were taken into consideration during the development of the HTML webpage (due to the non-black/white colour choice and the size customizability options), and allowed for greater knowledge to be attained about GUI layout and choices. These pieces of feedback were especially important as they were about readability, instead of layout or features; something I was not good at doing well. Thus, this feedback allowed for a weakness of mine to be improved on, ensuring it will not affect future assessments.

However, more focus should have been placed on formatting aspects of each individual element in the website.
 - “The table of contents on the left could be tidied a little, possibly by making the links the same style as the hyperlinks at the top”
 - “The cards in your website research section are good, but I believe you should probably have formatted the text in them a little cleaner, something about them feels cluttered”.

All constructive criticism given was about the text contained in elements throughout the webpage; this was not given much importance during development, as it was believed the overall layout would be more important. Thus, future assignments will more greatly consider how text inside elements is set up. This is more possible due to knowledge being gained about the layout of a website due to the research done for the assessment.

UIs are what allow humans to interact with a device's underlying code (Juviler, 2022). In future, any task involving user interactions, such as one using flask or any other data science software as a back-end, will need a front-end to be designed, otherwise it will not be not useful to a user. Thus, the skills and knowledge gained from these assessments will be useful in any future Information Technology studies, as they will make the process of front-end development easier to do.
