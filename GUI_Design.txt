The main focus of Term 3 was HTML and the development of a webpage. However, this was supported by assessment items from the previous term; notably, the PySimpleGui tasks.

Pysimplegui was, personally, easier to format than HTML. This was partially due to having had more time to learn python (as an entire assignment was dedicated to doing so beforehand); whereas, there was a much smaller time slot to learn html. This meant, when developing the Pysimplegui applications, more focus could be directed toward the layout, as changes were easy to make. Additionally, Pysimplegui formatting was more simple, due to simply being lists within lists; in contrast, HTML formatting required use of the different tags, their positioning, their properties and more.
In that regard, the PySimpleGUI assessments served as an introduction to GUI development, as lesser-known, simpler softwares were used to get the 'feel' of GUI development, before a more official language was used. 

Thus, the feedback gotten from the PySimpleGui assessments assisted in the development of the HTML webpages. For example, note the specific feedback, given on the previous assessments, shown below:

 - The white text on black can be a bit hard to read clearly at small fonts, so be careful with that
 - You could also bump the font size up a bit in general, as there’s a lot of screen real estate you’re not using

These were taken into consideration during the development of the HTML webpage, and allow for greater knowledge to be attained about GUI layout and choices.
