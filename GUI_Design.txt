The main focus of Term 3 was HTML and the development of a webpage. However, this was supported by assessment items from the previous term; notably, the PySimpleGui tasks.
For example, note the specific feedback, given on the previous assessments, shown below:

 - The white text on black can be a bit hard to read clearly at small fonts, so be careful with that
 - You could also bump the font size up a bit in general, as there’s a lot of screen real estate you’re not using

These were taken into consideration during the development of the HTML webpage, and allow for greater knowledge to be attained about GUI layout and choices.
